Mailer package. This package is responsible for Mailing.

This package is being completely revamped. The current CMailer and SMTPMailer will be
replaced with newer classes. The idea is to have a Email Queue and one can just push the
email in the queue and leave the rest to the PRE for emailing. The queue will be serialized
and therefore in case of shutdown immediate condition, the pending emails will not be lost.
