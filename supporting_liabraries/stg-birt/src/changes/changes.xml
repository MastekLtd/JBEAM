  		IExecutableBatchJob interface API has changed. The existing implementation classes will have to undergo changes
  		with respect to the new API. There is no backward compatibility. This change was necessary as the old interface
  		forced the implementor to add class level variables. Now all the variables are passed to methods such as init,
  		execute and destroy.

  		<action issue="83" date="7/22/2011" type="fix" dev="mandarv">
  		NullPointerException was thrown by CoreComm while doing the validations during the installation. 
  		Instead of showing what configuration is missing, it threw a NullPointerException. 
  		Handled the null condition and corrected the code to show the missed configuration.
