BIRT Report Package. 
This package contains classes that help to execute BIRT reports. The static methods in ReportGenerator class should be
used to generate the reports. The ReportService class manages the lifecycle of the BIRT Platform. Create an instance of Report, 
pass all relevant report parameters and then call the ReportGenerator to generate the report. The service class works as a singleton 
pattern and the caller should not make use of this class. Ideally a demon process should keep the Report Service up and ready for all
the clients to use.
