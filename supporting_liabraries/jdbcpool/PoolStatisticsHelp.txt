Pool Started On
This number is the Java representation of getTime() method in Calendar.

Connections High
The highest number of concurrent connections that were in use during the lifetime of the pool.

Leaked Resultset
The count of Resultsets that were opened but not explicitly closed by calling resultset.close() method during the lifetime of the pool.

Leaked Statements
The count of Statements that were opened but not explicitly closed by calling statement.close() method during the lifetime of the pool.

Leaked Connections
The count of Connections that were requested from the pool and not explicitly closed by calling the connection.close() method.  

Current Used Connections
The count of connections that are in currently in use.

Current Free Connections
The count of connections that are lying in the pool waiting for service.

Bad Connections Found
The count of connections that were either killed or had a broken JDBC (TCP/IP) link.

Current Waiters
The count of requesters waiting for connection to be made available.

Waiters High
The highest number of requesters waiting for a connection to be made available during the lifetime of the pool.

Wait Time High
The highest wait time the requester waited for a connection to be made available in the pool.

Total Wait Time
Total wait time for all the requesters who waited for a connection to be made available in the pool.

Average Connection Delay
Cumulative time taken by connections to be established divided by total number of connections established.

Connections Total
Total number of connections in the pool.

Unavailable Connections
Number of connections that were unavailable for requesters due to the internal pool checks.

Unavailable Connections
Highest number of Connections not available for requesters due to the internal pool checks.

Unavailable Connections High Time
Highest time the connections were unavailable for service.

Used Memory
Memory being used by the JVM (application(s)).

Total Memory
Total Memory available to the JVM (application(s)).

The following are statistical data collected between two consecutive runs for Self Check mechanism. For subsequent Self Check run the data is reset.
[ST]Connections Requested
    Total connections requested by the consumer.
[ST]New Connections Requested
    Total number of new connections requested by the POOL to satisfy the consumer.
[ST]Connections Created
    Total number of new connections created by the pool (based on capacity increment)
[ST]Connections Locked
    Total idle connections locked by the Self Check execution (meaning these connections were not available during the self check period). 
[ST]Connections UnLocked,103,
    Total connections unlocked by the self check execution.
[ST]Connections Closed,0
    Total connections closed during the self check execution.
