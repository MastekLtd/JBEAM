Admin Package. This package contains 2 classes that relate to the PRE. These are used to send
requests to PRE to soft reboot and stop the PRE. These two classes are called from shell scripts
namely rebootEng.sh and stopEng.sh respectively.
The package also contains a class that can generate insert scripts. This is not related to PRE but I did not knew
where to keep this class.
