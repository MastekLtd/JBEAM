Commons

* Introduction

  Commons is a package that collates all common utilities together to form a collection of programs.

* Rationale

  There were various utility tools that were created for generic usage and these were scattered across multiple projects.
  This project aims at consolidating all such tools/utilities and brings them under a commmons platform.
